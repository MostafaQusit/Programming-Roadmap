## Programming Fundamentals: Why They Are Crucial

### The Importance of Fundamentals in Learning Programming

From my perspective, the fundamentals are incredibly important for several reasons:

1. **Control over Technology**: Understanding the basics allows you to control the technology rather than just being a user. You'll understand why and when to use a particular component, how it affects the performance of your application, or how it optimizes memory usage.

2. **Customization**: Knowledge of the fundamentals will enable you to customize the technology when necessary.

3. **Ease of Learning New Technologies**: A solid foundation makes it much easier to learn and work with new technologies you haven't encountered before.

As the saying goes, in any field, to master your work, you need to have a strong foundation.

The main issue is often in the basics because the knowledge builds upon itself. But I'll try to send you some links and a learning path, but keep in mind that the effort is needed from your side too. You need to explore and learn on your own as well.


## Recommended Resources for Beginners (Non-CE Graduates)

If you're not a Computer Engineering (CE) graduate and you're struggling with the basics, the following resources will help you build a strong foundation:

### **Step 1: Understanding Basic Concepts**

### **Step 4: Programming Languages and Paradigms**

Programming languages are divided into two main categories:

1. **Imperative Programming Paradigm**:
   - **Procedural Programming**: e.g., C language
   - **Object-Oriented Programming**: e.g., C++, C#, JavaScript (supports OOP)

2. **Declarative Programming Paradigm**:
   - **Functional Programming Paradigms**: e.g., LINQ in .NET

I recommend starting with **C** as it's a powerful language that will significantly impact your career.
